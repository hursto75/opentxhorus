The JustFly 'AppMan' is a customisable user interface for the OpenTX radio operating system, written in LUA.
It can be launched from the SDcard browser on your OpenTX radio.
It comes as part of any product purchased on this site, and is not available as separate purchase.

It is also installable as telemetry script, so you can easily start it by long pressing the PAGE button (on the 'Taranis' X7, X7S, X9D, X9D+) or as a widget on any basic screen (on the 'Horus' X0, X10S, X12S). 

It consist of a menu structure to easily access any standard LUA script that will run on your radio:

Next to that, a set of custom pages to support the general setup and tuning of your models is included, like adapting the servo order of your model by the click of a button, or visualising the controls on your plane.

Additional model support menus are available for the included predefined models. A license key can be purchased to unlock these extra menu pages.

Finally, specific apps can be purchased, such as the JustFly app, that will show a graphical representation of the altitude during your flying session.
