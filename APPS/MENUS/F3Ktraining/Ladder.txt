5.7.11.4. Task D (Increasing time by 15 seconds)

Each competitor has an unlimited number of flights for each target flight time.

Each competitor must try to complete the first flight of 30 seconds or more.
Once this is accomplished, each of the next target flight times must be incremented by 15 seconds therefore flight times should be equal to or more than: 
30 s; 45 s; 60 s;75 s; 90 s; 105 s; 120 s.

The longest target flight time is 120 seconds.
The time of all the achieved target flight times is taken into account for scoring.

Working time is 10 minutes.

Example: 

1st flight 32 s target time of 30 seconds is achieved; flight score is 30 points.
The next target flight is 45 seconds.
2nd flight 38 s 45 seconds not reached, score 0
3rd flight 42 s 45 seconds not reached, score 0
4th flight 47 s target time of 45 seconds is achieved; flight score is 45 points; partial score is: 30 + 45 points. The next target flight is 60 seconds
5th flight 81 s target time of 60 seconds is achieved; flight score is 60 points.
The next target flight should be 75 seconds but the remaining working time is only 65 seconds therefore the next target flight cannot take place.
The total score for the task is: 30+45+60 = 135 points
