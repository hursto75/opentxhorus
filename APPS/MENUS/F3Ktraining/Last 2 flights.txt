5.7.11.2. Task B (Next to last and last flight)

Each competitor has an unlimited number of flights, but only the next to last and the last flight will be scored.

Maximum time per flight is 240 seconds for 10 minutes working time.
If the number of competitors is large, the maximum flight time may be reduced to 180 seconds and 7 minutes working time.

Example: 

1st flight 65 s
2nd flight 45 s
3rd flight 55 s
4th flight 85 s
Total score: 55 s + 85 s = 140 s
