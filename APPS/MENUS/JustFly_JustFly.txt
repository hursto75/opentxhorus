The JustFly 'task' will allow you to simply time your flights, and have a graph logged per flight.

It works as a normal task, but sounds are disable, apart from launch height announcement.
The working time is set to 60 minutes, and the target time as well. Unlimited flights.
So you can just fly and try to improve your best flight within the hour working time.

Have Fun and Just Fly!
