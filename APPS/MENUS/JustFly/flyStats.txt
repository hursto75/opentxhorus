Flight stats as registered by the JustFLy app.
Any demo flight where there is no receiver powered up and bound to the transmitter, are not taken into account.
 
All values are 'stored' in an unused servo channel labeled 'height'.
Resetting the servo trim settings for this servo to default will reset the flight
statistics.
